Another 4 months and another goa release! goa `v1.3.0` is out! This version
includes new features and a slew of bug fixes. Thank you to all the contributors
that spent a lot of time writing (and sometimes re-writing) the code, the tests
and the docs. The list below highlights the main contributions.

## New Features

### 10x Code generation speed improvement on Windows

Klaus Post identified an issue where goagen was re-opening the generated files
too often. Opening the files only once during code generation resulted in a 10x
speed increase on Windows!

[#1330](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1330) - Klaus Post + Raphael Simon

### Custom error merge algorithm

Bryce Reitano introduced a [new
interface](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/blob/v1/error.go#L98-L106) that
error structs returned by error classes may implement to control how errors are
merged before being rendered into HTTP responses. This makes it possible to
control the error response bodies more effectively.

[#1321](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1321) - Bryce Reitano

### Hash key and value validations

@ikawaha added support for Hash key and value validations to the DSL. Example
usage:

```go
var _ = Resource("resource", func() {
	Action("action", func() {
		Routing(POST(""))
		Payload(func() {
			Member("hash", HashOf(String, Integer,
				func() { Pattern("[a-zA-Z]+") },  // Validates keys
				func() { Enum(12, 3, 4, 5, 6) },  // Validates values
			))
		})
	})
})
```

[#1298](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1298) - @ikawaha

### Support for http.FileSystem in file servers

Taichi Sasaki added the ability to use http.FileSystem when defining file
servers. This makes it possible to use `assetfs` to serve data defined in
memory, for example:

```go
ctrl.FileSystem = func(dir string) http.FileSystem {
	return &assetfs.AssetFS{
		Asset:     Asset,
		AssetDir:  AssetDir,
		AssetInfo: AssetInfo,
		Prefix:    dir,
	}
}
```
[#1297](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1297) - Taichi Sasaki

### New --regen flag for bootstrap and main command

Ian McCracken added the ability to re-generate the code for controllers and the
main file taking advantage of the fence comments to capture user code and write
it back. See the [Scaffolding](https://goa.design/implement/goagen/) section of
the website for more information.

[#1246](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1246) - Ian McCracken

### RFC1123 time format support

Taichi Sasaki also added support for the RFC1123 time format when defining
validations. This makes it possible to automatically validate the format of
`If-Modified-Since` and other standard headers with date time values.

[#1248](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1248) - Taichi Sasaki

### Collection Media Type Identifier

Another contribution from Taichi Sasaki makes it possible to specify the media
type identifier for collection media types overriding the default computed by
goa.

[#1232](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1232) - Taichi Sasaki

* Large integers in validations are now rendered correctly in the validation code. [#1336](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1336) - Klaus Post + Raphael Simon
* Default values for Numbers that are integers are now rendered correctly in the generated code. [#1344](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1344) - Klaus Post + Raphael Simon

## Update: goa v2 coming soon!

The initial development for goa v2 is nearing completion. If you are interested
in trying out the latest and greatest then install it with:

```bash
go get goa.design/goa/...
```

and give it a shot:

```bash
# Generate code for goa v2 "cellar" example
cd $GOPATH/src
mkdir cellar; cd cellar
goa gen goa.design/goa/examples/cellar/design

# Generate default server and client tool main
goa example goa.design/goa/examples/cellar/design

# Build and run default server
cd cmd/cellarsvc; go build; ./cellarsvc
```

in a different terminal:

```bash
# Build and use default client tool
cd $GOPATH/src/cellar/cmd/cellarcli
go build; ./cellarcli --help
./cellarcli -verbose storage list
```
