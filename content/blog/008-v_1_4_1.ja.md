`goa v1.4.1` is out! This release contains a few bug fixes and mainly updates the
`uuid` package dependency to a maintained repository.

## New Features

### UUID Package Update

v1.4.1 updates the import of the UUID package to `github.com/gofrs/uuid` instead
of the original `github.com/satori/go.uuid` which isn't maintained anymore.

### Support for default GOPATH and Go modules

Taichi Sasaki added the ability for `goagen` to use the default `GOPATH` if none is set
explicitely (as defined in Go 1.8). Taichi also added support for Go modules to `goagen`!
