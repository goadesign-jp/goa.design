Today I am very pleased to announce the release of goa `v1.2.0`! This release
contains all the changes made in the `v1` branch of goa for the past 4 months -
since the release of `v1.1.0`.

## New Team Members!

While not directly related to this release this seems like a good opportunity to
officially announce that [Taichi Sasaki](https://github.com/tchssk)
and [Michael Boke](https://github.com/michaelboke) have both joined to goa team!

Taichi was one of the first contributors to goa, his contributions are always of
the highest quality. Apart from fixing many bugs and contributing actively to
goa v2, Taichi also helped translate the entire https://goa.design/ja website
into Japanese.

Michael is a long time user of goa and has already contributed some of the most
intricate code generation algorithms to goa v2 including the server-side HTTP
transport.

Both Taichi and Michael have already made a big impact on the development of v2
and I'm looking forward to collaborating with them on the next set of features!

## New Features

The main new features that come with `v1.2.0` are:

* The use of the stdlib `context` package instead of
  `golang.org/x/net/context`. While technically a breaking change not a single
  user voted against that change in the poll issue (actually most people really
  wanted it). [[#1177](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1177)]

* The entire [goa.design](https://goa.design/ja) website is now translated into
  Japanese thanks to the Herculean work
  of [Taichi Sasaki](https://github.com/tchssk)
  and [@ikawaha](https://github.com/ikawaha) !!.

* The generic
  [tracer](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/blob/v1/middleware/tracer.go)
  middleware makes it possible to load tracing headers in the request context.
  The
  [xray](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/blob/v1/middleware/xray/) package
  takes advantage of that to report traces to
  [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/). Checkout the
  [blog post](https://goa.design/blog/004-xray/) for more details.
  [Dominic Metzger](https://github.com/dominicm) fixed a number of issues in the
  initial implementation and added the ability to trace at the transport level.

  [[#1005](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1005)]
  [[#1026](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1026)]
  [[#1028](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1028)]
  [[#1129](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1129)]
  [[#1175](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1175)]
  [[#1185](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1185)]

* The JWT middleware now supports the ECDSA signing methods thanks to the
  excellent work of
  [Tony Spataro](https://github.com/xeger).
  [[#1014](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1014)]

* The new goagen `controller` command makes it possible to re-generate the
  scaffold for a single controller thanks to the work of
  [Hector Fernandez](https://github.com/hectorj2f).
  [[#1049](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1049)]
  [[#1122](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1122)]

## Minor Additions

There were a few niceties added to goa `v1.2` as well:

* [Scott Messier](https://github.com/smessier) made is possible to set the
  request ID in the client request context.
  [[#981](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/981)]

* [Otto Giron](https://github.com/ottogiron) refactored all the generators with
  nice constructor methods making it more convenient to use code generation
  programmatically.
  [[#993](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/993)]
  [[#1001](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1001)]

* [Bryce Reitano](https://github.com/brycereitano) added the ability for goagen
  to generate the code that initializes the query string parameters with the
  default values defined in the design.
  [[#1024](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1024)]

* The generated code include headers that match the Go standard for generated
  code as described in
  [the corresponding Go issue](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/13560).

* It is now possible to use DSL when defining `Hash` attributes. The function takes
  two DSLs, the first applies to the hash keys and the second to the values.
  This makes it possible to attach validations and metadata to the hash keys and
  values.
  [[#1172](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1172)]

## Bug Fixes

As always this release also comes with a number of bug fixes, in particular:

* [Peter Dulaƒçka](https://github.com/rootpd) fixed the rendering of DateTime
  values in request paths. [[#970](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/970)]

* Peter also fixed the rendering of parameters in client requests paths.
  [[#977](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/977)].

* [Bryce Reitano](https://github.com/brycereitano) fixed the detection of custom
  encoder packages. [[#974](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/974)]

* Bryce also made sure that the generated client includes a proper header
  comment. [[#980](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/980)]

* Bryce also found a missing error handling in the controller code generation
  algorithm which would cause confusing errors.
  [[#1118](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1118)]

  execution. [[#979](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/979)]

  tool flag use "kebab" case. [[#1043](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1043)]

  generated CORS paths.
  [[#1068](https://github.com/goadesign/goa/pull/1068)]

  response status code as an internal
  error.

As you can see a lot of work went into this release, many thanks to all the contributors!!

Looking forward I'm hoping the next release will be v2! v1 will stay around for
a while though so I expect a `v1.3.0` release 4 months from now.
